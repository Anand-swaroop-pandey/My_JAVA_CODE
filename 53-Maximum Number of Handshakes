/*
To maximize the number of handshakes, each person should shake hand with every other person in the room. For the first person, there would be N-1 handshakes. For second person there would N-1 person available but he had already shaken hand with the first person. So there would be N-2 handshakes and so on. 
So, Total number of handshake = N-1 + N-2 +â€¦.+ 1 + 0, which is equivalent to ((N-1)*N)/2 
(using the formula of sum of first N natural number).
